# ICS3U Unit 1 Research Assignment: Emerging Technologies

Choose one emerging technology from the list below (or propose your own with approval). Research it, then present your findings in a Markdown (`.md`) file in GitHub.

## Step 1: Choose a Topic
- Generative AI  
- Quantum Computing  
- Cybersecurity  
- Role of Computer Science in the Medical Field  
- Autonomous Vehicles  
- Augmented Reality  
- Virtual Reality  
- 5G  
- Sustainable Technology  
- Blockchain  
- Cryptocurrency  
- Edge Computing  
- Biotechnology in Agriculture  
- Green Energy Technologies  
- Wearable Health Monitors  
- Voice-Activated Technology  
- Robotics  
- Biocomputing  

**Note:** You may choose your own technology that is not on this list, but you must get approval from your teacher.

## Step 2: Research
As you research your topic, make sure you are able to answer the following questions:

### A. Understanding the Technology
- What is this technology, and how does it work?  
- Where is it currently being used, and how might it be used in the future?  

### B. Environmental Stewardship & Sustainability
- What resources (energy, materials, hardware) does this technology require?  
- What are the positive and negative impacts on the environment? On human health?  

### C. Postsecondary Opportunities
- What jobs or careers involve this technology?  
- What postsecondary programs could lead to working with this technology?  
- What skills are important in this field (technical and non-technical)?  

## Step 3: Present Your Technology
- Create your own GitHub Repository. Note that this done automatically when you "accepted" this assignment on GitHub Classroom.
- Write your research report in the [README.md](README.md) file of your repo.
- Use Markdown syntax to add formatting, contextual links, and images to your document.
- Your report must contain the following Markdown elements:
  - Headers
  - Paragraphs  
  - Line Breaks  
  - Emphasis (**bold**, *italic*)  
  - Blockquotes  
  - Images  
  - Links  
- While formal citations and bibliographies are not required, you are expected to:
  - Use wiki-style [inline links](CITATIONS.md) to clearly indicate where specific facts, definitions, or claims come from.
  - Embed links directly on relevant words or phrases (e.g., key terms, technologies, organizations) rather than placing raw URLs on their own lines.
  - Use links to support accuracy, not to pad the document with unrelated sources.

## Assessment
### Research Content
**Explains the chosen technology, its uses, environmental impacts, and career or education pathways.**

| Level | Description | Marks |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Level 4 | Thorough, well-researched explanation of the technology; insightful discussion of environmental stewardship, sustainability, and career or education pathways, supported with specific examples. | 8 |
| Level 3 | Clear explanation of the technology; accurate discussion of environmental impacts and career or education connections with some supporting details. | 6 |
| Level 2 | Some understanding of the technology; identifies basic environmental or career aspects but with limited depth. | 4 |
| Level 1 | Limited explanation of the technology; little evidence of research; vague or inaccurate connections to sustainability and careers. | 2 |

### Markdown Formatting & Presentation
**Uses Markdown syntax to structure the report and make it visually clear and engaging.**

| Level | Description | Marks |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Level 4 | Consistent, professional Markdown formatting; creative and effective use of headers, links, images, and blockquotes; all required elements included and enhance the report. | 4 |
| Level 3 | Most Markdown elements used effectively; formatting makes the document clear and engaging; required elements are present. | 3 |
| Level 2 | Some Markdown elements used; formatting improves readability somewhat but may be inconsistent; some required elements missing. | 2 |
| Level 1 | Minimal Markdown use; document is difficult to read; required elements such as headers, images, links, or blockquotes missing or misused. | 1 |

### Repository & File Maintenance
**Demonstrates proper organization of files and use of GitHub repository structure.**

| Level | Description | Marks |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Level 4 | Report is written in `README.md`; original instructions remain untouched in `INSTRUCTIONS.md`; any additional files such as linked images are neatly organized in appropriate folders. | 2 |
| Level 3 | Work is in the correct file (`README.md`); `INSTRUCTIONS.md` mostly left untouched; some organization of additional files is evident but not consistent. | 1.5 |
| Level 2 | Some files are present but organization is inconsistent; work may appear in the wrong file; instructions may be altered or overwritten. | 1 |
| Level 1 | Files are missing or misplaced, or the work is done in an unexpected location such as not being in `README.md`. | 0.5 |

### Commit History & Workflow
**Shows consistent work habits and professional communication through [commits](COMMIT_MESSAGES.md) and commit messages.**

| Level | Description | Marks |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Level 4 | Frequent, meaningful commits that clearly document progress; commit messages are professional, specific, and informative. | 8 |
| Level 3 | Regular commits show progress; most commit messages are descriptive. | 6 |
| Level 2 | Some commits made; messages are brief or generic. | 4 |
| Level 1 | Few or no commits; commit messages uninformative or missing. | 2 |

## Markdown Reference & Best Practices
- Read about [Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
- **Headers:** Use different header levels (`##`, `###`, etc.) to create a hierarchy and organize your sections, like chapters and subheadings in a textbook.  
- **Inline Links:** Add contextual links directly in your text (e.g., linking to a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)) so readers can explore more information.  
- **Images:** Use images to highlight key ideas and add visual impact. Images can be linked from the web, but uploading them to your repository is more reliable, since external links may break or disappear.  
- **Blockquotes:** Use blockquotes (`>`) to emphasize important definitions, quotes, or key ideas.
