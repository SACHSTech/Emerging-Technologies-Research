# Sources, Links, and Citations

The Emerging Technologies research isn't meant to be a traditional English research paper. In other words, you are not required to use parenthetical citations or a mandatory *Works Cited* page.

The model you should follow is a **Wikipedia-style explainer**. Think of using:

- Clear explanations written in your own words
- Information organized for readability
- Sources shown through links embedded directly in the text

Your responsibility is to make it clear **where information comes from** and to show that your explanations are based on real research.

## 1. Inline Links Are the Default

Most of your sources should appear as **inline links** inside your paragraphs.

Use inline links when you:
- Define or explain technologies
- Mention a company, organization, standard, or product
- Refer to real-world uses, statistics, or examples

Example:

```
Generative AI systems such as [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) are trained on large datasets and use [neural networks](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/neural-networks) to generate human-like text.
```

This would appear like:

> Generative AI systems such as [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) are trained on large datasets and use [neural networks](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/neural-networks) to generate human-like text.

This is the preferred approach. It mirrors how Wikipedia provides context without interrupting the reading flow.

## 2. Blockquotes for Definitions or Key Ideas

If you quote or closely paraphrase a definition or important statement, use a **blockquote**, followed by a link to the source.

Example:

```
> Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans.
> — [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence)
```

This would appear like:

> Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans.  
> — [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence)

Blockquotes should be used sparingly! They are for emphasizing important ideas, not for copying large amounts of text.

## 3. When a Works Cited or References Section Makes Sense

A **Works Cited** or **References** section is optional, i.e., not required.

Include one only if:
- You rely heavily on a small number of major sources
- You reference the same article, report, or study multiple times
- You use non-obvious sources such as research papers, government reports, or industry white papers

If you include one, place it at the **bottom of your README.md** and format it clearly.

Example:

```
## References

- IBM. "What Is Artificial Intelligence?" https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence
- World Economic Forum. "Top 10 Emerging Technologies." https://www.weforum.org/
```

Do not add a References section that simply repeats links already embedded meaningfully in the text unless it adds clarity.

## 4. What Does NOT Count as Proper Sourcing

The following will result in lost marks:
- No links at all
- A list of random links pasted at the bottom with no connection to the text
- Claims presented as facts with no indication of where the information came from
- Copy-pasted content without quotation or attribution

## 5. How This Is Assessed

Sourcing is evaluated under **Research Content** and **Markdown Formatting and Presentation**.

Level 4 work:
- Uses inline links naturally and consistently
- Shows clear evidence of research
- Integrates sources into explanations instead of listing them separately

Level 2 or below:
- Few or poorly chosen links
- Weak connection between claims and sources
- Sources exist but are not integrated into the writing
